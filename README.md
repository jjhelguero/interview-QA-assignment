# Myndshft Applicant Take Home
_Quality Engineer_

## Introduction

The purpose of this Takehome assignment is to submit a small practical project that demonstrates your capabilities.
We respect your time, so please do not exceed 4 hours for this project.  We would rather see as much work submitted as possible even if it isn't complete.

## Time Limit

4 Hours.

Please don't take any longer as we want to be respectful of your time.

MAKE SURE YOU PUSH YOUR CODE OFTEN.  You will not be able to push to the repository after the time limit.


## Reflection

Please add a file named `REFLECTION.md` in this project and submit it with the rest of your work.  In this file, please list out anything else you would do differently if you had more time allotted, any questions that you would ask the business and/or development team, etc.

## Instructions

We would like for you to create a suite of automated tests for a very simple API.

There is a simple API specification in the `/docs` directory.  Note that there is not an actual application that you will test against.  We want you to do this exercise as if the documentation was created before the development.

We would like for you to complete as much of the following as possible:

1. Write automated tests (or as many as possible) using the provided API document.  
    - Use a tool/framework/library of your choice - please provide brief instructions on how to run the tests.
2. Document what you would do differently in `REFLECTION.md`
3. Document any questions that you would have for the business or dev team in `REFLECTION.md`
